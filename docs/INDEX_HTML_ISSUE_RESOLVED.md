# Missing index.html Issue RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified

You were unable to run `npm run dev` because the **root `index.html` file was missing**. In Vite React projects, you need:

1. **Root `index.html`** - For development server (`npm run dev`)
2. **dist/index.html** - Built version for production

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've created the missing **root `index.html`** file with the correct structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>LiveOn - Blood Donation Platform</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 100 100'><text y='.9em' font-size='90'>❤️</text></svg>">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 🔧 Key Differences

### Root index.html (Development)
- Located at: `D:\Xampp\htdocs\Liveonv2\index.html` ✅
- Points to: `/src/main.jsx` (source files)
- Used by: `npm run dev` development server

### Dist index.html (Production) 
- Located at: `D:\Xampp\htdocs\Liveonv2\dist\index.html` ✅
- Points to: Built assets (e.g., `/assets/index-CP_Dpujx.js`)
- Used by: Production deployment

## 🚨 Additional Requirement: Node.js

To run `npm run dev`, you also need **Node.js installed**. If it's not installed:

### Install Node.js:
1. Download from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install the LTS version
3. Restart your terminal
4. Verify with: `node --version` and `npm --version`

### Or use existing Node.js:
If Node.js is installed but not in PATH, you might need to:
1. Check if it's in: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`
2. Add to Windows PATH environment variable
3. Restart your terminal

## 🎯 Current Project Structure

```
D:\Xampp\htdocs\Liveonv2\
├── index.html           # ✅ ROOT INDEX (for development)
├── package.json         # ✅ npm scripts configuration
├── vite.config.js       # ✅ Vite configuration
├── src/
│   ├── main.jsx         # ✅ React entry point
│   ├── App.jsx          # ✅ Main App component
│   └── components/      # ✅ React components
├── dist/
│   └── index.html       # ✅ Built version (for production)
└── ...other files
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once Node.js is properly installed, you should be able to run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite development server
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Load your React application
4. Enable hot module replacement for development

## ✅ Issue Status: RESOLVED

The missing `index.html` file has been created. Your project structure is now complete for both development and production use!
