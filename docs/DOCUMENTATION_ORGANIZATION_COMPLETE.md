# Documentation Organization Complete ✅

## Files Successfully Moved to `docs/` Folder

Both cleanup documentation files have been moved from the project root to the `docs/` folder for better organization:

### Moved Files:
1. **`CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md`** → **`docs/CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md`**
   - Main project cleanup report covering 50+ removed files
   - Complete analysis of test files, debug files, and duplicate documentation removal

2. **`CRON_DATABASE_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md`** → **`docs/CRON_DATABASE_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md`**
   - Specialized cleanup report for cron and database folders
   - Analysis of 7 removed setup/testing files while preserving production essentials

### Updated Documentation Index:
The `docs/README.md` file has been updated to include references to these cleanup reports under a new "Cleanup Reports" section.
